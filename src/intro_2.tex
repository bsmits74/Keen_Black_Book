My personal introduction to computer gaming started in 1985, when my parents bought a MSX-1 Home Computer. I was fascinated by games such as Knightmare and Nemesis 2. It was not only the gameplay that interested me, but also how such games are developed. That's how I started my deep interest into programming and learned about sprites and side-scrolling techniques.\\
In the same year I had my first computer experience, Nintendo released a game called Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was an instant blockbuster; it combined great graphics with smooth side scrolling. Earlier side scrolling games, like Knightmare and Nemesis 2, moved at constant screen speed. Super Mario Bros was different, as the player dictates the scrolling speed. You could smoothly accelerate from walk to run or jump, and the screen would smoothly follow your actions. Super Mario Bros was immensely successful, both commercially and critically. It helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre,and served as a killer app for the NES\footnote{Upon release in Japan, 1.2 million copies were sold during its September 1985 release month. Within four months, about 3 million copies were sold in Japan}.
