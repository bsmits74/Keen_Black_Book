Development was done with Borland C++ 3.1 (but the language used was C) which by default ran in EGA mode 3 offering a screen 80 characters wide and 25 characters tall.\\
\par
John Carmack took care of the runtime code. John Romero programmed many of the tools (TED5 map editor, IGRAB asset packer, MUSE sound packer). Jason Blochowiak wrote important subsystems of the game (Input manager, Sound manager, User manager).\\
\par
Borland's solution was an all-in-one package. The IDE, \cw{BC.EXE}, despite some instabilities allowed crude multi-windows code editing with pleasant syntax highlights. The compiler and linker were also part of the package under \cw{BCC.EXE} and \cw{TLINK.EXE}\footnote{Source: Borland C++ 3.1 User Guide.}.\\

There was no need to enter command-line mode however. The IDE allowed to create a project, build, run and debug.\\

Another way to improve screen real estate was to use "high resolution" 50x80 text mode.\\

\section{Graphic Assets}
\label{section:graphic_assets}

All graphic assets were produced by Adrian Carmack. All of the work was done with Deluxe Paint (by Brent Iverson, Electronic Arts) and saved in ILBM\footnote{InterLeaved BitMap.} files (Deluxe Paint proprietary format). All assets were hand drawn with a mouse.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
 \fullimage{deluxe_paint.png}
 \caption{Deluxe Paint was used to draw all assets in the game.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Assets Workflow}
After the graphic assets were generated, a tool (IGRAB) packed all ILBMs together in an archive and generated a header table file (\cw{KDR}-format) and C header file with asset IDs. The engine references an asset directly by using these IDs.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/drawing_plain.eps}
 \caption{Asset creation pipeline for graphics items}
 \label{asset-creation-pipeline}
\end{figure}
\par
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
 \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/assets_header.c}\par
 \end{minipage}
 
 In the engine code, asset usage is hardcoded via an enum. This enum is an offset into the \cw{HEAD} table which contains an offset in the \cw{DATA} archive. The \cw{HEAD} table files are stored in the \cw{\textbackslash static} folder as \cw{*.KDR} files.\\

\subsection{Assets file structure}
\label{section:asset_file_structure}
Figure \ref{fig:asset-file} shows the structure of the \cw{KDREAMS.EGA} asset file.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/graphic_assets.eps}
 \caption{File structure of \cw{KDREAMS.EGA} asset file.}
 \label{fig:asset-file}
\end{figure}

The \cw{pictable[]} contains the width and height in bytes for each picture in the asset file. Note that a width of 5 bytes means a size of 40 pixels on the screen. The same size structure is applied for mask pictures.\\

  \begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabularx}{0.8\textwidth}[c]{XXX}
  \hline
  \textbf{index} & \textbf{width} & \textbf{height}   \\ \hline
  0             & 5          & 32    \\
  1             & 5          & 32    \\
  2             & 5          & 32    \\
  3             & 5          & 32    \\
  4             & 5          & 32    \\
  5             & 5          & 32    \\
  6             & 5          & 32    \\
  7             & 5          & 32    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  64             & 5          & 24    \\
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{content of pictable[].}
  \end{table}



The \cw{spritetable[]} contains beside width and height in bytes also information on the sprite center, hit boundaries and number of shifted sprites, which will be explained in section \ref{section:draw_sprites} on page \pageref{section:draw_sprites}. \\
\par


The font segment contains a table for the height (same for all characters) and width of the font, as well as a reference where the character data is located.\\
\par
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
 \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/font_structure.c}\par
 \end{minipage}

  \centering 
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, frame]{screenshots_300dpi/font.png}
  \caption{Font asset data.}
  \label{fig:font_assets}
\end{figure} 

Since all tiles have fixed dimension (either 8 or 16 pixels), there is no need to store any tile size table structure. \\

\par
From \cw{STARTPICS} location onwards all graphical assets are stored. Each asset contains four planes, aligned with the EGA architecture. Foreground tiles and sprites include a mask plane as well.

\section{Maps}
Maps were created using an in-house editor called TED5, short for Tile EDitor. Over the years TED5 had improvements and the same tool is later used for creating maps of both side-scrolling games and top-down games like Wolf 3D.\\
\par
 TED5 is not stand-alone; in order to start, it needs an asset archive and the  associated header (as described in the graphic asset workflow Figure \ref{asset-creation-pipeline} on page \pageref{asset-creation-pipeline}). This way, texture IDs are directly encoded in the map.\\

 
 \fullimage{TedSplashscreen.png}
 \par
 \trivia{The suffix, "vD.IP", was put in by the Rise of the Triad team in 1994. It stood for "Developers of Incredible Power".}\\
 \par
\fullimage{Fill_2.png}\\
 


 \fullimage{ted5_scrolling_map.png}\\
\par



 \par
 TED5 allows placement of tiles on layers called "planes". In Commander Keen, layers are used for background, foreground and information planes. Note that foreground tiles are always using a mask as they are overlayed with the background. The info plane contains the location of actors and special places. Each foreground and background tile could also be enriched with additional tile information such as tile clipping and animated tiles. Just like IGRAB, the TED5 tool generated a header table file (\cw{KDR}-format) and a \cw{*.MAP} file containing the levels. Figure \ref{fig:map-header-file} shows the map header table structure, which is hard-coded in the source code.\\
 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/map_header.eps}
 \caption{File structure of \cw{MAPHEAD.KDR} header file.}
 \label{fig:map-header-file}
\end{figure}
\par

\subsection{Map header structure}
The header offset and header size refer to the location and size in the \cw{KDREAMS.MAP} file. A maximum of 100 maps is supported in the game.\\
\par
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
 \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/map_header_structure.c}\par
 \end{minipage}

\subsection{Background tile information}
For background tile animation two information tables are required: tile animation and tile animation speed. The tile animation refers to the next tile in the animation sequence. So in case of tile \#90 in Table \ref{table:background tile anim}, the next animation tile is \#91 (+1), followed by \#92 (+1) and \#93 (+1). After tile \#93 (-3) the sequence is going back to tile \#90. The animation speed is expressed in TimeCount, which is the number of ticks before the next tile is displayed. \\
 \begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}[c]{XXX}
  \hline
  \textbf{index} & \textbf{tile animation} & \textbf{tile animation speed}   \\ \hline
  0             & 0          & 0    \\
  1             & 0          & 0    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  57             & 1          & 32    \\
  58             & -1          & 24    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  90             & 1          & 8    \\
  91            & 1          & 8    \\
  92             & 1          & 8    \\
  93             & -3          & 8    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Background tile animation.}
  \label{table:background tile anim}
  \end{table}

\subsection{Foreground tile information}
\label{section:foreground_tile_info}
The foreground tiles contain, beside tile animation (similar like background tiles), also clipping and 'inside' tile information.\\
\par
The clipping tables contain how Commander Keen is clipped against foreground tiles. 'Inside' tile information is used to climb on a pole and mimics Commander Keen going through a floor opening ('inside' the tile). In section \ref{section:clipping} both the clipping and 'inside' logic is further explained.\\
\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}[c]{XXXXXXX}
  \hline
  \textbf{index} & \textbf{clip north} & \textbf{clip east} & \textbf{clip south} & \textbf{clip west}  & \textbf{inside tile} \\ \hline
  ...    & ...     & ...    & ...   & ...     & ...      \\
  238    & 0       & 1      & 5     & 0       & 0        \\
  239    & 0       & 0      & 0     & 0       & 0        \\
  240    & 0       & 0      & 5     & 0       & 0        \\
  241    & 0       & 0      & 0     & 0       & 128       \\
  242    & 1       & 1      & 1     & 1       & 128       \\
  243    & 1       & 0      & 1     & 0       & 0       \\
  244    & 0       & 0      & 2     & 0       & 0       \\
  ...    & ...     & ...    & ...   & ...     & ...     \\
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Foreground tile clipping and 'inside' tile information.}
  \end{table}


\pagebreak
 
\subsection{Map file structure}
The structure of \cw{KDREAMS.MAP} is explained in Figure \ref{fig:map-file}. For each map there is a small header containing the width, height and name of the map as well as a reference pointer to each of the three planes. Each plane exists out of a map of tile numbers for foreground, background and info.\\

\section{Audio}
\subsection{Sounds}
The original Commander Keen Triology did only support the default PC Speaker. Only with the introduction of Commander Keen Dreams the team decided to support sound cards.\\

\par
\bu{Trivia :} Apogee, the publisher of Ideas from the Deep, didn't publish any game with Adlib support until Dark Ages in 1991. And even then it still had pc speaker music.\\
\par




As mentioned in Chapter \ref{hardware-audio}, audio hardware was highly fragmented. id supported four sound cards and the default PC speaker, which meant generating assets multiple times for each and packing them together with an in-house tool called MUSE into an AUDIOT archive (an id software proprietary format):\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

   \fullimage{muse.png}
  \caption{MUSE splash screen.}
 \end{figure}
 \par
 
id Software intended for Keen Dreams to have music and digital effects support for the Sound Blaster \& Sound Source devices. In fact, Bobby Prince composed the song "You've Got to Eat Your Vegetables!!" for the game's introduction. However, Softdisk Publishing wanted Keen Dreams to fit on a single 360K floppy disk, and in order to do this, id Software had to scrap the game's music at the last minute. The team didn't even have time to remove the music setup menu.\\

\par
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scaledimage{1.0}{music.png}{}
\caption{Setup music menu in Keen Dreams, although there is no music in the game.}
\end{figure}
\par


\par
\bu{Trivia :} The song "You've Got to Eat Your Vegetables!!" would finally make its debut in Commander Keen IV: Secret of the Oracle.\\
\par

 Two sets of each audio effect shipped with the game:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For PC Speaker
\item For AdLib
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Sound effects}
All sound effects are done by Robert Prince. In the early days of the OPL soundcards, the "gold standard" sequencing software was Sequencer Plus Gold ("SPG") by Voyetra. The reason for this was it had an OPL instrument/instrument bank editor. To rough out compositions, Robert used Cakewalk ("CW").\\

      \scaledimage{1}{music_editor.png}
\caption{Sequencer Plus Gold ("SPG") by Voyetra.}
\end{figure}


What goes in the \cw{AUDIOT} archive is a music and sound effect format called IMF\footnote{Id software Music File.}. As it supports only the YM3812, it is tailored for the chip with zero abstraction layers. It consists of a stream of machine language commands with associated delays\footnote{IMF format is explained in detail on page \pageref{IMF_explanation}}.\\
\par
 The stream pilots the nine channels in the OPL2. A channel is able to simulate an instrument and play notes thanks to two oscillators, one playing the role of a modulator and the other the role of a carrier. There are many other ways to control a channel such as envelope, frequency or octave.\\
\par The way a channel is programmed is described in detail in Section \ref{IMF_explanation}, "\nameref{IMF_explanation}" on page \pageref{IMF_explanation}.\\

 \caption{Architecture of a YM3812 channel.}
\end{figure}
\par
\bu{Trivia :}  The YM3812's unmistakable sonority is due to its peculiar set of waveform transformers (they are right after the output of each oscillator in the drawing). Four waveforms are available on the OPL2: Sin \circled{1}, Abs-sin\circled{2}, Pulse-sin \circled{3}, and Half-sin \circled{4}.

\section{Distribution}
On December 14th, 1990 the first episode was released via Apogee. Episodes 1-5 are all published as shareware by Apogee Software. The game engine and first episode were given for free and encourages to be copied and distributed to a maximum number of people. To reveive the oher episodes, each player had to pay \$30 (for Episide 1-3) to ideas from the Deep.\\

\par
Commander Keen in Keen Dreams was published as a retail title by Softdisk, as part of a settlement for using Softdisk resources to make their own game\footnote{The settlement with Softdisk is explained in detail on page XXXX}.\\

In 1990, the Internet was still in its infancy and the best medium was the 3\nicefrac{1}{2}-inch floppy disk. The game shipped as follows:\\

  \par
 The files can be divided in seven parts:
\begin{itemize}
 \item KDREAMS.EXE: Game engine.
 \item KDREAMS.EGA: Contains all the assets (sprites, tiles) needed during the game.
 \item KDREAMS.AUD: Sound effect files.
 \item KDREAMS.MAP: Contains all levels layouts.
 \item KDREAMS.CMP: Introduction picture of the game, which is a compressed LBM image file.
 \item Softdisk Help Library files, which are text screens, shown when starting the game
 \begin{itemize}
   \item START.EXE: Decompress and show user guide, and then start the game.
   \item LOADSCN.EXE: Shows the closing screen when quiting the game. Decompresses the ENDSCN.SCN chunk in LAST.SHL
   \item *.SHL: Text user guide assets. 
 \end{itemize}
 \item Several *.TXT files which can be read in DOS by typing the corresponsing *.BAT file. 

\end{itemize}
