Development was done with Borland C++ 3.1 (but the language used was C) which by default ran in EGA mode 3 offering a screen 80 characters wide and 25 characters tall.\\
\par
John Carmack took care of the runtime code. John Romero programmed many of the tools (TED5 map editor, IGRAB asset packer, MUSE sound packer). Jason Blochowiak wrote important subsystems of the game (Input manager, Sound manager, User manager).\\
\par
Borland's solution was an all-in-one package. The IDE, \cw{BC.EXE}, despite some instabilities allowed crude multi-windows code editing with pleasant syntax highlights. The compiler and linker were also part of the package under \cw{BCC.EXE} and \cw{TLINK.EXE}\footnote{Source: Borland C++ 3.1 User Guide.}.\\

There was no need to enter command-line mode however. The IDE allowed to create a project, build, run and debug.\\

Another way to improve screen real estate was to use "high resolution" 50x80 text mode.\\

\section{Graphic Assets}
\label{section:graphic_assets}

All graphic assets were produced by Adrian Carmack. All of the work was done with Deluxe Paint (by Brent Iverson, Electronic Arts) and saved in ILBM\footnote{InterLeaved BitMap.} files (Deluxe Paint proprietary format). All assets were hand drawn with a mouse.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
 \fullimage{deluxe_paint.png}
 \caption{Deluxe Paint was used to draw all assets in the game.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Assets Workflow}
After the graphic assets were generated, a tool (IGRAB) packed all ILBMs together in a compressed archive and generated a header table and dictionary file (\cw{KDR}-format\footnote{both \cw{KDR}-files are located in the \cw{static} folder of the source code.}) and C header file with asset IDs. The engine references an asset directly by using these IDs.\\
\begin{figure}[H]

 \label{asset-creation-pipeline}
\end{figure}
\par
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
 \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/assets_header.c}\par
 \end{minipage}
 
 In the engine code, asset usage is hard-coded via an enum. This enum is an offset into the \cw{HEAD} table which contains an offset in the \cw{DATA} archive. 

\pagebreak

\subsection{Assets archive file structure}
\label{section:asset_file_structure}
Figure \ref{fig:asset-file} shows the structure of the \cw{KDREAMS.EGA} asset archive file. The first sections contain data tables for pictures and sprites, followed by the font and finally all graphs.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/graphic_assets.eps}
 \caption{File structure of \cw{KDREAMS.EGA} asset file.}
 \label{fig:asset-file}
\end{figure}

Boh the \textbf{pictable[]} and \textbf{picmtable[]} contain the width and height for each (masked) picture in the asset file.\\

  \begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabularx}{0.8\textwidth}[c]{XXX}
  \hline
  \textbf{picture index} & \textbf{width (bytes)} & \textbf{height (bytes)}   \\ \hline
  0             & 5          & 32    \\
  1             & 5          & 32    \\
  2             & 5          & 32    \\
  3             & 5          & 32    \\
  4             & 5          & 32    \\
  5             & 5          & 32    \\
  6             & 5          & 32    \\
  7             & 5          & 32    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  64             & 5          & 24    \\
  \end{tabularx}
  %\caption{content of \cw{pictable[]} and \cw{picmtable[]}.}
  \end{table}



The \textbf{spritetable[]} contains, beside width and height, also information on the sprite center, hit boundaries and number of bitshifts. Sprites will be explained in detail in section \ref{section:draw_sprites} (page \pageref{section:draw_sprites}). \\
\par


The \textbf{font} segment contains a table for the height (same for all characters) and width of the font, as well as a reference where the character data is located.\\

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, frame]{screenshots_300dpi/font.png}
  \caption{Font asset data.}
  \label{fig:font_assets}
\end{figure} 

\par
After the (mask) pictures and sprites graphs, starting \cw{STARTPICS}, the 8- and 16-bit size (masked) tiles are stored. Each asset contains four planes, aligned with the EGA architecture. All masked tiles and sprites include an additional mask plane as well.

\section{Maps}
Maps were created using an in-house editor called TED5, short for Tile EDitor. Over the years TED5 had improvements and the same tool is later used for creating maps of both side-scrolling games and top-down games like \textit{Wolfenstein 3D}.\\
\par
 TED5 is not stand-alone; in order to start, it needs an asset archive and the  associated header (as described in the graphic asset workflow Figure \ref{asset-creation-pipeline} on page \pageref{asset-creation-pipeline}). This way, texture IDs are directly encoded in the map.\\

 
 \fullimage{TedSplashscreen.png}
 \par
 \trivia{The suffix, "vD.IP", was put in by the Rise of the Triad team in 1994. It stood for "Developers of Incredible Power".}\\
 \par
\fullimage{Fill_2.png}\\
 
 \par
TED5 allows placement of tiles on layers called "planes". In Commander Keen, there are three type of planes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Background plane
  \item Foreground plane, which is a mask over the background plane
  \item Information plane, containing location of actors and special places
\end{itemize}
A level is created by placing tiles on each of these three layers. Each foreground and background tile could be enriched with additional tile information. It controls how everything interacts with tiles, like tile clipping, "deadly" tiles and animated tiles. \\

 \par
\fullimage{ted5_tile_info.png}\\
 
 \par

Just like IGRAB, the TED5 tool packed all levels together in a compressed \cw{MAP} archive and generated a header and dictionary file (\cw{KDR}-format). \\
 
\subsection{Map header structure}
The map header structure is part of the engine code and contains a header offset and size, which refers to the location and size in the \cw{KDREAMS.MAP} archive file. \\

\par
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
 \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/map_header_structure.c}\par
 \end{minipage}

A maximum of 100 maps is supported in the game. The \cw{tileinfo[]} data contains information for tile interaction. 


 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/map_header.eps}
 \caption{File structure of \cw{MAPHEAD.KDR} header file.}
 \label{fig:map-header-file}
\end{figure}
\par

For background tile animation two information tables are defined: \textbf{tile animation} and \textbf{tile animation speed}. The tile animation refers which tile, relative to this tile, the tile will animate to. So in case of tile \#90 (see Table \ref{table:background tile anim}), the next animation tile is \#91 (+1), followed by \#92 (+1) and \#93 (+1). After tile \#93 (-3) the sequence is going back to tile \#90. The animation speed is expressed in \cw{TimeCount}, which is the number of ticks before the next tile is displayed. \\
 \begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}[c]{XXX}
  \hline
  \textbf{index} & \textbf{tile animation} & \textbf{tile animation speed}   \\ \hline
  0             & 0          & 0    \\
  1             & 0          & 0    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  57             & 1          & 32    \\
  58             & -1          & 24    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  90             & 1          & 8    \\
  91            & 1          & 8    \\
  92             & 1          & 8    \\
  93             & -3          & 8    \\
  ...             & ...          & ...    \\
  \end{tabularx}
  %\caption{Background tile animation.}
  \label{table:background tile anim}
  \end{table}
  
  \par
The foreground tiles contain, beside tile animation (similar like background tiles), also clipping and 'inside' tile information.\\
\par
The clipping tables contain how Commander Keen is clipped against foreground tiles. 'Inside' tile information is used to climb on a pole and mimics Commander Keen going through a floor opening ('inside' the tile). In section \ref{section:clipping} (see page \pageref{section:clipping}) both the clipping and 'inside' logic is further explained.\\
\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}[c]{XXXXXXX}
  \hline
  \textbf{index} & \textbf{clip north} & \textbf{clip east} & \textbf{clip south} & \textbf{clip west}  & \textbf{inside tile} \\ \hline
  ...    & ...     & ...    & ...   & ...     & ...      \\
  238    & 0       & 1      & 5     & 0       & 0        \\
  239    & 0       & 0      & 0     & 0       & 0        \\
  240    & 0       & 0      & 5     & 0       & 0        \\
  241    & 0       & 0      & 0     & 0       & 128       \\
  242    & 1       & 1      & 1     & 1       & 128       \\
  243    & 1       & 0      & 1     & 0       & 0       \\
  244    & 0       & 0      & 2     & 0       & 0       \\
  ...    & ...     & ...    & ...   & ...     & ...     \\
  \end{tabularx}
  %\caption{Foreground tile clipping and 'inside' tile information.}
  \end{table}


\pagebreak
 
\subsection{Map archive structure}
The structure of \cw{KDREAMS.MAP} archive is explained in Figure \ref{fig:map-file}. For each map there is a small header containing the width, height and name of the map as well as a reference pointer to each of the three planes. Each plane exists out of a map of tile numbers for background, foreground and info.\\

\section{Audio}
\subsection{Sounds}
The original Commander Keen Trilogy did only support the default PC Speaker. Only with the introduction of Commander Keen Dreams the team decided to support sound cards.\\

\par
\bu{Trivia :} Apogee, the publisher of Ideas from the Deep, didn't publish any game with AdLib support until \textit{Dark Ages} in 1991. And even then it still had pc speaker music.\\
\par




As mentioned in Chapter \ref{hardware-audio}, audio hardware was highly fragmented. Commander Keen supported three sound cards and the default PC speaker, which meant generating assets multiple times for each and packing them together with an in-house tool called MUSE into an AUDIOT archive (an id software proprietary format):\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

   \fullimage{muse.png}
  \caption{MUSE splash screen.}
 \end{figure}
 \par
 
id Software intended for Keen Dreams to have music and digital effects support for the SoundBlaster \& Sound Source devices. In fact, Bobby Prince composed the song "You've Got to Eat Your Vegetables!!" for the game's introduction. However, Softdisk Publishing wanted Keen Dreams to fit on a single 360K floppy disk, and in order to do this, id Software had to scrap the game's music at the last minute. The team didn't even have time to remove the music setup menu.\\

\par
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scaledimage{1.0}{music.png}{}
\caption{Setup music menu in Keen Dreams, although there is no music in the game.}
\end{figure}
\par


\par
\bu{Trivia :} The song "You've Got to Eat Your Vegetables!!" would finally make its debut in Commander Keen IV: Secret of the Oracle.\\
\par

As a consequence, only two sets of each audio effect are shipped with the game:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For PC Speaker
\item For AdLib
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Sound effects}
All sound effects are done by Robert Prince. In the early days of the OPL soundcards, the "gold standard" sequencing software was Sequencer Plus Gold ("SPG") by Voyetra. The reason for this was it had an OPL instrument/instrument bank editor. To rough out compositions, Robert used Cakewalk ("CW").\\

\centering
      \scaledimage{1}{music_editor.png}
\caption{Sequencer Plus Gold ("SPG") by Voyetra.}
\end{figure}


What goes in the \cw{AUDIOT} archive is a music and sound effect format called IMF\footnote{Id software Music File.}. As it supports only the YM3812, it is tailored for the chip with zero abstraction layers. It consists of a stream of machine language commands with associated delays\footnote{IMF format is explained in detail on page \pageref{IMF_explanation}}.\\
\par
 The stream pilots the nine channels in the OPL2. A channel is able to simulate an instrument and play notes thanks to two oscillators, one playing the role of a modulator and the other the role of a carrier. There are many other ways to control a channel such as envelope, frequency or octave.\\
\par The way a channel is programmed is described in detail in Section \ref{IMF_explanation}, "\nameref{IMF_explanation}" on page \pageref{IMF_explanation}.\\
\par

 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/channel.eps}
 \caption{Architecture of a YM3812 channel.}
\end{figure}
\par
\bu{Trivia :}  The YM3812's unmistakable sonority is due to its peculiar set of waveform transformers (they are right after the output of each oscillator in the drawing). Four waveforms are available on the OPL2: Sin \circled{1}, Abs-sin\circled{2}, Pulse-sin \circled{3}, and Half-sin \circled{4}.

\section{Distribution}
On December 14th, 1990 the first episode was released via Apogee. Episodes 1-5 are all published by Apogee Software. The game engine and first episode were given for free and encourages to be copied and distributed to a maximum number of people. To receive the other episodes, each player had to pay \$30 (for Episode 1-3) to \textit{ideas from the Deep}.\\

\par
Commander Keen in Keen Dreams was published as a retail title by Softdisk, as part of a settlement for using Softdisk resources to make their own game\footnote{The settlement with Softdisk is explained in Appendix \ref{sec:id_software}}.\\

In 1990, the Internet was still in its infancy and the best medium was the 3\nicefrac{1}{2}-inch floppy disk. The game shipped as follows:\\

  \par
 The files can be divided in seven parts:
\begin{itemize}
 \item KDREAMS.EXE: Game engine.
 \item KDREAMS.EGA: Contains all the assets (sprites, tiles) needed during the game.
 \item KDREAMS.AUD: Sound effect files.
 \item KDREAMS.MAP: Contains all levels layouts.
 \item KDREAMS.CMP: Introduction picture of the game, which is a compressed LBM image file.
 \item Softdisk Help Library files, which are text screens, shown when starting the game
 \begin{itemize}
   \item START.EXE: Decompress and show user guide, and then start the game.
   \item LOADSCN.EXE: Shows the closing screen when quitting the game. Decompresses the ENDSCN.SCN chunk in LAST.SHL
   \item *.SHL: Text user guide assets. 
 \end{itemize}
 \item Several *.TXT files which can be read in DOS by typing the corresponding *.BAT file. 

\end{itemize}
