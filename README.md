This is the source code for the Game Engine Black Book: Commander Keen.
I am releasing the source code (.tex) under GPL license. I
retain ownership of all drawings and only provide them so the
overall thing is compilable.

The following tools are used to create and compile the book:
 - LaTeX as word processor
 - Texmaker 5.1.3 as LaTeX editor
 - Inkscape 1.4.3 for the drawings
 - GIMP 3.0.8 for editing images

Everything is build on Ubuntu (Mint), to compile:
 - Install TeX Live library and Texmaker:
    - `sudo apt install texlive texlive-font-utils texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra texmaker`
 - Install Inkscape:
    - `sudo apt install inkscape`
 - Open 'book.tex' in Texmaker and run "Quick Build"
